# bikesharing

### Overview
We were asked to create visualizations of bike-sharing data to determine if the business model would be sustainable and/or profitable in other locations. For this project, we used data from CitiBike in New York City from August 2009 in the form of a CSV(text) file. We then used Pandas to convert the datatype of the trip duration column.  Once the data was transformed, we loaded it in to Tableau to create the visualizations.  In Tableau, we created multiple worksheets, dashboards and a story to share with potential investors.  
### Results
[NYC CitiBike Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lindsey.asterman/viz/NYCCitiBikeStory_16549080246990/NYCCitiBikeStory?publish=yes)

- The most popular stations and start locations were concentrated in Manhattan.  The number of rides was adversely affected as you leave the city center.  This suggest that dense population centers are best for a bike-sharing business.

- Subscribers made up 81% of the total rides. The majority of users likely live in the area they are riding in and regulary use the service. Other customer rides are potentially from tourists or one time riders.

- The peak hours are 8am-9am and 4pm-7pm. This coincides with regular business hour commutes suggesting riders are using the bikes for transportation to and from work.

- Ride times are concentrated around the morning and evening workday commute.  Rides times are slighlty consolidated around mid-day on the weekends, suggesting biking for leasure activities.

- Ride times show the same distribution between females and males, while the third gender has no significant pattern.

- The user trips by type highlights that the male subscriber is the key demographic of users.

- The most frequent trip duration for male customers is only five (5) minutes. The high frequency of short trips is also true for the other two genders. Most rides are no longer than 30 minutes.
