# bikesharing

### Overview
We were asked to create visualizations of bike-sharing data to determine if the business model would be sustainable and/or profitable in other locations. For this project, we used data from CitiBike in New York City from August 2009 in the form of a CSV(text) file. We then used Pandas to convert the datatype of the trip duration column.  Once the data was transformed, we loaded it in to Tableau to create the visualizations.  In Tableau, we created multiple worksheets, dashboards and a story to share with potential investors.
